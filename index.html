          Hotland is a fictional communist democratic utopia founded by Kevin Feng and Jeremy Lin. Since October 26, 2021, the day Hotland was founded, the population of Hotland has steadily increased to over 2000, which is attributed to the booming technological sector. Located in the northwestern half of Australia, Hotland has many natural resources, including renewable energy, ores, livestock, crops, and water.

          Using innovative variable-length terms, Hotland averts disastrous political situations. Each president is elected for five years at a time for a maximum of ten years. Every year, an approval vote is held, with the president replaced if two approval votes are lost in a row. This system provides adequete stability while preventing corruption.
